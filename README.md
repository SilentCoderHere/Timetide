# ⏳ TimeTide

**TimeTide** is a simple and modern countdown & countup events app built with **Flutter** using **Material Design 3 (MD3)**.  
It helps you track important dates, deadlines, or milestones in a clean and organized way.

I built this app because I couldn’t find one that does this job simply and beautifully.
